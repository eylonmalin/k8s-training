# Task-9: Volume Mount Directory from the Node File-System
In this task we would like to persist the DB data.
1. Add label to one of the nodes using **kubectl label node kind-worker app=letschat** command
2. Create some directory for mongofb inside the node 
  > * You can use `docker exec -it kind-worker bash`
3. Add nodeSelector to the Lets-Chat-DB Deployment and volume to the hostPath
  > * The mountPath for persisting mongodb should be /data/db
4. Check in Browser, even after restart pod User is persistent
